Example and their relevans to the thesis:



Seven segments example:
Will I use it: Yes.

- It shows a good idea of the basic structure
- Monitor processes (simple)
- Data generation

-- Verify that overflow does not happen


AddOne:
Will I use it: Yes. I can show how the programmer has to add the extra process
and then afterwards show how we can be sure it will never go above x.
It is a simple problem that resembles Seven segment example, but it shows
how the program needs the data generation process.

- Data generation, how not to do it.

-- Verify that overflow does not happen (Like Seven segment)


Traffic Light:
Will I use it: Maybe

- Data generation by a source process
- Monitor proces get data from two channels. It is a different way of verifying
- Sending data from one process to the other
