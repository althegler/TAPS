Unit test ideas:

Channels:
    - A channel is generated with proper name from bus
    - A channel is generated with proper ranges and types
    - If channel has a value i SMEIL, the cspm range matches that
    - If the bus is defined in the network the cspm channel name matches that
    -


Processes:
    - A process input variable is translated without bus.channelname
    - A process that calculates something on a line with communication will
        be translated with the correct communication and translation
    - A process will generate proper calculations with parenthesis
    - A process is able to receive more than one input variable
    -

Network:
    - A network will be created with the correct input channel
    - A network with several input channels will be able to translate properly
    - A network will generate the syncronization with the correct parentheses
    - A network will generate the syncronization with a sink process correctly
    - A network will generate the syncronization with monitor processes correctly

Monitor:
    - A monitor will be able to generate correct range calculations
    - A monitor will be able to generate "other" types of verification
    - A monitor will be able to receive more than one input.
    - A monitor will be able to use more than one input for verification


Assert:
    - An assert will be able to use the correct network for verification
    - An assert will be able to use other types of refinements
